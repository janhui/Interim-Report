	Abstract = {Reliable indoor positioning is an important foundation for emerging indoor location based services. Most existing indoor positioning proposals rely on a single wireless technology, e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or RFID. A hybrid positioning system combines such technologies and achieves better positioning accuracy by exploiting the different capabilities of the different technologies. In a hybrid system based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the former works as the main infrastructure to enable fingerprint based positioning, while the latter (via hotspot devices) partitions the indoor space as well as a large Wi-Fi radio map. As a result, the Wi-Fi based online position estimation is improved in a divide-and-conquer manner. We study three aspects of such a hybrid indoor positioning system. First, to avoid large positioning errors caused by similar reference positions that are hard to distinguish, we design a deployment algorithm that identifies and separates such positions into different smaller radio maps by deploying Bluetooth hotspots at particular positions. Second, we design methods that improve the partition switching that occurs when a user leaves the detection range of a Bluetooth hotspot. Third, we propose three architectural options for placement of the computation workload. We evaluate all proposals using both simulation and walkthrough experiments in two indoor environments of different sizes. The results show that our proposals are effective and efficient in achieving very good indoor positioning performance.},

Location dependent sensor data transfers could be optimized by means of local positioning services. Many start-up companies have available proprietary positioning systems meeting the unique requirements of each application. Therefore, the use of a standard like Bluetooth{\texttrademark} is a step towards a universal solution. Our system provides location services for mobile industrial and biomedical Bluetooth{\texttrademark} -enabled sensors. The RSSI distance estimation, together with a GPS-like triangulation algorithm, lead to a 3 m error positioning system with remote and self positioning topologies. A real time positioning tracking system for one mobile sensor is provided in this article.},

@book{Cauchard2012,
	Abstract = {Emerging smartphones and other handheld devices are now being fitted with a set of new embedded technologies such as pico-projection. They are usually designed with the pico-projector embedded in the top of the device. Despite the potential of personal mobile projection to support new forms of interactivity such as augmented reality techniques, these devices have not yet made significant impact on the ways in which mobile data is experienced. We suggest that this `traditional' configuration of fixed pico-projectors within the device is unsuited to many projection tasks because it couples the orientation of the device to the management of the projection space, preventing users from easily and simultaneously using the mobile device and looking at the projection. We present a study which demonstrates this problem and the requirement for steerable projection behaviour and some initial users' preferences for different projection coupling angles according to context. Our study highlights the importance of flexible interactive projections which can support interaction techniques on the device and on the projection space according to task. This inspires a number of interaction techniques that create different personal and shared interactive display alignments to suit a range of different mobile projection situations.},

Three different ways of positioning with Bluetooth have been developed. With a registered positioning service, a Bluetooth device has an active role in the positioning task, where a connected device to look up respective position in a database uses the unique address of the device. It is also possible to forward a position gained from the positioning platforms using the peer-to-peer characteristics in Bluetooth. The theoretical time requirements for a positioning system based on Bluetooth are discussed. Empirical tests show that these requirements hold.},

Positioning is based on received power levels, which are converted to distance estimates according to a simple propagation model. The extended Kalman filter computes a 3D position estimate on the basis of distance estimates. With the used Bluetooth hardware, the mean absolute error of positioning was measured to be 3.76 m. The accuracy can be improved if Bluetooth devices are able to measure received power levels more precisely.},

These networks are very adequate in environments where other positioning technologies, as satellite systems, do not work. Bluetooth is a promising technology, since it is present in any kind of portable devices. By using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) it is possible to make an estimation of the distance between a transmitter and a receiver. By using this information, it is possible to develop an algorithm that estimates positions, even with the bluetooth constraints when the RSSI is obtained. Our experimental results show that our algorithm, based on a particle filter, can achieve a good performance.},

	Abstract = {Huge popularity of mobile devices and Internet open new application field of wireless positioning and navigation systems, and this integration also brings new research issues. Currently the positioning and navigation systems are mostly based on satellite positioning systems, such as GPS. One serious drawback of these satellite based positioning and navigation systems is that they can only operate in outdoor environment. There are several approaches for wireless positioning, e.g. cell ID, DOA (directions of arrivals) or signal strength measurements, but these approaches can not meet requirements of wireless positioning, including latency, availability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new approach for Bluetooth positioning, which is based on the time offset acquisition of signals propagating over radio channel, and the forward-backward ranging. Through simulations and experiments, it shows that the new Bluetooth ranging approach could give high ranging accuracy with modest modifications of current Bluetooth technology.},

In order to dynamically enlarge an interaction area for the purpose of shared use, a flexible coupling of displays has been realized that overcomes the restrictions of display sizes and borders. Two ConnecTable displays dynamically form a homogeneous display area when moved close to each other. The appropriate triggering signal comes from built-in sensors allowing users to temporally combine their individual displays to a larger shared one by a simple physical movement in space. Connected ConnecTables allow their users to work in parallel on an ad-hoc created shared workspace as well as exchanging information by simply shuffling objects from one display to the other. We discuss the user interface and related issues as well as the software architecture. We also present the physical realization of the ConnecTables.},
